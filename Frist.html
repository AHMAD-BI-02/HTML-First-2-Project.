		<h1>10 Study Tips to Improve Your Learning</h1>
		<h2>Study Tip 1: Underlining</h2>
		<p>nderlining is one of the simplest and best known study tips. It’s easy to highlight the most significant parts of what you’re reading. Ideally you should do a comprehensive read of a text before you even consider underlining anything. Only on the second reading should you proceed to underline the most notable aspects.The act of underlining something means you are engaging with certain key aspects of the text. There is no need to go crazy and highlight entire blocks of text. You should highlight one key sentence per paragraph and a few important phrases here and there. You can only retain a certain amount so it’s best to retain the most important information.</p>
		<h2>Study Tip 2: Make Your Own Study Notes</h2>
		<p>Taking Notes is one of the most widespread study skills out there. Essentially the aim of note-taking is to summarise lectures or articles in your own words so you can easily remember the ideas. In most cases, the key is to be able to summarise the content as quickly as possible while not leaving out any key info.When creating Notes, you can do it the traditional way with the good ol’ pen and paper or you can utilise online tools, such as GoConqr’s Notes feature.</p>
